  abstract = {?Spirituality? often has been framed in social science research as an alternative to organized ?religion,? implicitly or explicitly extending theoretical arguments about the privatization of religion. This article uses in?depth qualitative data from a religiously diverse U.S. sample to argue that this either/or distinction not only fails to capture the empirical reality of American religion, it does no justice to the complexity of spirituality. An inductive discursive analysis reveals four primary cultural ?packages,? or ways in which people construct the meaning of spirituality in conversation: a Theistic Package tying spirituality to personal deities, an Extra?Theistic Package locating spirituality in various naturalistic forms of transcendence, an Ethical Spirituality focusing on everyday compassion, and a contested Belief and Belonging Spirituality tied to cultural notions of religiosity. Spirituality, then, is neither a diffuse individualized phenomenon nor a single cultural alternative to ?religion.? Analysis of the contested evaluations of Belief and Belonging Spirituality allows a window on the ?moral boundary work? being done through identifying as ?spiritual but not religious.? The empirical boundary between spirituality and religion is far more orous than is the moral and political one.},

  abstract = {Effective communication between healthcare professionals and patients is critical to patients' health outcomes. The doctor/patient dialogue has been extensively researched from different perspectives, with findings emphasising a range of behaviours that lead to effective communication. Much research involves self-reports, however, so that behavioural engagement cannot be disentangled from patients' ratings of effectiveness. In this study we used a highly efficient and time economic automated computer visualisation measurement technique called Discursis to analyse conversational behaviour in consultations. Discursis automatically builds an internal language model from a transcript, mines the transcript for its conceptual content, and generates an interactive visual account of the discourse. The resultant visual account of the whole consultation can be analysed for patterns of engagement between interactants. The findings from this study show that Discursis is effective at highlighting a range of consultation techniques, including communication accommodation, engagement and repetition.},

Paul Avis describes and evaluates contemporary expressions of spirituality, drawing on many empirical studies; the functions of the Church's 'occasional offices' or rites of passage; the ways in which the Church and its ministers can engage constructively with the community and with civil society; the pastoral method in mission and its practical, policy consequences. Throughout the book Avis urges the imperative for the Church and its ministers to break out from the privatization of Christian values into full participation in contemporary social issues and public life. This book is an authoritative and interdisciplinary study of theology and practice: a much-needed applied theology of mission and ministry for today.},

We found that three-quarters of the ministers have experience with euthanasia requests from their parishioners. Almost two-thirds of them respect a parishioner's euthanasia request. Differentiating the answers on the basis of modality, we see differences in attitudes, both regarding euthanasia itself and regarding the pastoral approach. Although ministers have considerable experience with euthanasia, the open questions posed reveal that ministers encounter many difficulties and dilemmas: there is urgent need for discussion and support. The article intends to contribute to the search for a best pastoral practice in dealing with euthanasia requests and explores the need for a renewed role for the PKN in the social and political debate on euthanasia.},

What factors contribute to Mass attenders' sense of belonging to their parish community? Does it depend only on the personal characteristics of the attenders, or do the characteristics of the parish and even the diocese also have an impact? This article explores these questions by employing a multilevel modelling approach to questionnaire responses from Mass attenders in a national random sample of Catholic parishes across Australia that took part in the 2006 National Church Life Survey. Findings include that Mass attenders' country of birth has an important influence on their sense of belonging, and also that parish priests can influence Mass attenders' sense of belonging in a very powerful way, not only through their style of presiding at the liturgy but also through their ability to communicate a clear vision for the parish, their ability to get people to work together, and a readiness to encourage parishioners to put their gifts and skills to use for the good of the parish.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {What does it mean to grow old? What makes later life meaningful? What gives a frail and isolated or institutionalised older person their sense of wholeness and self? This substantially updated new edition of Elizabeth MacKinlay's seminal text presents the latest theory and research to explore these questions in depth, pointing the way towards new ways of thinking about and engaging with the spirituality of ageing. Encompassing the findings of a new research study on baby boomer spirituality, the book presents a wider and more comprehensive view of ageing and spirituality, concluding that spirituality for the baby boomer generation is every bit as important as for the cohorts before them, but also fundamentally different, with fewer being practicing members of a religious faith. Drawing on in-depth interviews with older people, and containing many new ideas whilst also addressing the foundational theories and questions essential to scholarship in this field, the book also includes a new and timely chapter on the spirituality of older people in our increasingly multicultural and multifaith societies. This clear and practical text presents much-needed guidance for health and social care practitioners, chaplains, clergy and others seeking to identify and support the spiritual needs of older people, as well as students and researchers in related disciplines.},

  abstract = {Recent research on attachment in therapy indicates that therapist attachment style is related to therapists' agreement with their clients on the quality of their working alliance (WA; Kivlighan \& Marmarosh, 2016). This study builds on these findings by examining how both the therapist's and the client's attachment style may be related to their agreement on the WA. The authors expected that less anxious and less avoidant clients working with less anxious and less avoidant therapists would have higher WA agreement. Using hierarchical linear modeling, they analyzed archival session data from 158 clients and 27 therapists at a community clinic. In terms of overall level agreement (averaged across sessions), therapists and clients significantly disagreed on their WA ratings, with therapists rating the WA lower than did their clients; but there was more therapist-client level-agreement when therapists had relatively less attachment avoidance. In terms of (linear) WA agreement from session to session, the authors found no main effects for either therapist or client attachment style alone, but several significant interactions between therapist and client attachment styles. Session-to-session agreement on the WA was higher when clients and therapist had "matching" (both higher or both lower in attachment anxiety or attachment avoidance) or "complementary" (one higher in attachment avoidance, the other lower in attachment anxiety, or one higher in attachment anxiety, the other lower in attachment avoidance) attachment styles than when styles were noncomplementary. The authors discuss these findings in terms of the attachment-related communication, signaling, and behavior that may be occurring in therapy dyads.

The datasets cover a diversity of research areas, afford a breadth of analytical possibilities and are available to researchers in Australia and internationally. This paper presents a methodological overview of the \textsc{NCLS}, and discusses the strengths and limitations of the datasets. A particular strength is that all attenders in a participating local church are surveyed, enabling detailed work on congregational cultures and person-environment multi-level modelling approaches. The datasets have good national coverage and denominational diversity, and datasets of different types can be linked. Longitudinal studies on local churches are possible, with up to six data points. Catholic data are derived from random samples of parishes, however there are self-selection biases related to church size, locality and theological tradition in other denominations. Concerns about representativeness can be partially addressed through weighting procedures and the use of controls. Overall, the \textsc{NCLS} datasets are a high-quality resource for research in many areas of the social scientific study of religion, particularly in organisational studies, church health, and psychology and sociology of religion.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the empirical literature specific to the role of chaplaincy within health care published since 2009. Electronic searches of four databases were conducted in August 2015. After screening, 48 studies were retained and reviewed. Four themes emerged: experiences and perceptions of the health care chaplain (n = 15), chaplain practice (n = 9), emerging areas of health care chaplaincy (n = 16), and outcome studies (n = 8). Studies were diverse in topics covered, methods, national contexts, and clinical settings. The majority were descriptive in nature. Evidence continues to demonstrate a relationship between chaplains and increased patient satisfaction. Nascent areas of research include chaplain's role with diverse populations, involvement in clinical ethics, and confidence with research and evidence-based practice. Few conclusions can be drawn from the limited evidence on the outcomes of chaplain interventions.},

Within the tension between the communal and the individual, this paper explores first the indicators that help to understand preaching as a communal event, rather than an enumeration of meaning-making individuals; and secondly, how preaching can be understood as pastoral communication in the sense that the sermonic event could serve as caring environment for the worshipping community as a whole.

This paper offers an empirical study of innovation within 2,802 Australian congregations from 23 Protestant and Catholic denominations, based on the 2011 National Church Life Survey. Insights from organizational and leadership literatures were used to frame the dependent variable, `Innovative Church Culture' (\textsc{ICC}). The independent variables were attender worship service evaluation, local church social capital, leader innovativeness and local church size. Regression analyses were based on attenders' survey responses aggregated to the level of the local church. They were first run on the full sample, and then for each of six denominational subsamples: Anglican, Uniting, Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran and Pentecostal churches. Results found that worship service evaluation, social capital and church size explained almost half of the adjusted variance (46\%) in \textsc{ICC} in the full sample, and ranged from 24\% to 61\% for the subsamples. The strongest predictor was positive experience of worship services, followed by bonding/bridging social capital. Church size and leader innovativeness were only weak positive predictors of innovative culture. Leader innovativeness was a weak positive predictor. Cultural innovativeness differed between denominations, and was highest in Pentecostal churches. The paper provides commentary on these findings and concludes with suggestions for future empirical research on the sources and outcomes of innovation.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

A total of 59 interventions were identified and grouped into 10 categories by focus groups comprised of chaplains.

The two components were used in an OLS regression model to measure patient satisfaction. Interventions that comprise the ``Religious/Spiritual'' dimension may be considered to be specific skills that chaplains contribute to patient care and these have a slightly stronger correlation with patient satisfaction than the interventions of the ``Psychosocial'' dimension.},

Various scholars have also conceptualised health or vitality in more complex, multi-dimensional terms. However, stringent testing of the structure of such models has been limited. This study investigates vitality outcomes, using data from some 391,000 church attenders in nearly 4,700 Protestant congregations in four countries (Australia, UK, New Zealand, \textsc{USA}) from the 2001 International Church Life Survey. An empirical analysis was conducted using both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses across a wide range of items to determine if there was a common underlying structure in the reported experiences of church attenders. Results provide a strong empirical basis for two latent factors labelled `Collective Confidence', indicating satisfaction with the church and its leadership, and `Individual Commitment', indicating personal commitment to the faith. These factors are then compared to common themes within multi-dimensional frameworks of congregational vitality. These two emergent concepts are further refined with perspectives from both church vitality literature and from wider organisational studies.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Collective confidence is defined as an underlying group construct which reflects growth in faith through church, leadership that inspires people to action, and worship services that are inspiring. The unit of analysis is Australian Protestant congregations ({$<$}em{$>$}n{$<$}/em{$>$} = 1,059) at three points in time: 2001, 2006, and 2011. Structural Equation Modelling (\textsc{SEM}), which can infer directionality in ways cross-sectional studies cannot, was used to identify the model that best explains the link between the number of newcomers arriving over time and collective confidence. In particular the question of reciprocity is addressed, and the conclusion supports a model where Confidence and Newcomers reinforce each other: Confidence predicts higher Newcomers, and Newcomers also predict higher Confidence. The paper discusses possible reasons and perspectives for these results and suggests further work.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Dutch society is characterized by a high degree of religious dis-affiliation and nonaffiliation and most religious communities are facing hard times in the Netherlands. But there are also exceptions. Against the contemporary current of ongoing secularization, some religious communities seem to thrive like never before and even attract new members. But why is that? Why do some religious communities succeed in retaining and also attracting new members while others fail? This article focuses on successful evangelical congregations in the Netherlands and tries to account for their relative success. On the basis of a subcultural identity theory, it is argued that the success of evangelical congregations is largely due to the fact that they offer protective umbrellas of conservative belief in an otherwise very secular context. This line of thought is substantiated with empirical findings from a current research project into thriving evangelical congregations in the Netherlands. The article closes with some theoretical reflections on the future of evangelicalism in contemporary Dutch society.},

To do this, data gathered among members of six evangelical megachurches together with data from a national probability sample are analyzed to address two questions. First, to what extent are Dutch evangelicals more committed to their religious organization, in terms of money and time spent at church, than members of mainline churches in the Netherlands? And second, which decisive factors determine these instances of organizational commitment of Dutch evangelicals? Results show that evangelicals indeed spend more money on and time at church than mainline Christians. As regards the second question, it turns out that donating money is mainly determined by income, whereas time spent with church groups is mainly determined by the degree of embeddedness in socio-religious networks.},

The last section offers some suggestions for expanding several lines of current research in the future, including research: (1) to elucidate the nature of spiritual care chaplains provide to different populations, including patients, families and staff; (2) to assess the prevalence and intensity of patients' spiritual needs and the degree to which they are being met; (3) to identify that subset of patients who are spiritually at risk in terms of having high needs and slow religious resources; (4) to identify the biological causal mechanisms by which religion influences health; and (5) to measure the effectiveness of chaplain interventions.},

He masterfully constructs the sensemaking theoretical framework so that it can be better understood by the general scholar and in the process provides the reader with the sensemaking experience." --Kathleen Sutcliffe, University of Minnesota The teaching of organization theory and the conduct of organizational research have been dominated by a focus on decision making and the conception of strategic rationality. The rational model, however, ignores the inherent complexity and ambiguity of real-world organizations and their environments. Karl E. Weick's new landmark volume, Sensemaking in Organizations, highlights how the "sensemaking" process--the creation of reality as an ongoing accomplishment that takes form when people make retrospective sense of the situations in which they find themselves--shapes organizational structure and behavior. Some of the topics Weick thoroughly covers are the concept, uniqueness, historical roots, varieties and occasions, general properties, and the future of sensemaking research and practice. Expertly written, Sensemaking in Organizations is the volume that students, scholars, and professors of organization and management studies must have.},

  abstract = {Sensemaking involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a springboard into action. In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior, whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected, some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of which have changed in significance over time, and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented, more action oriented, more macro, more closely tied to organizing, meshed more boldly with identity, more visible, more behaviorally defined, less sedentary and backward looking, more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion. These key enhancements provide a foundation upon which to build future studies that can strengthen the sensemaking perspective.}

Canon law addresses some options for dioceses that need to restructure their parishes. This study considers three of them: pastoring multiple parishes through a team of pastors (Code of Canon Law 517.1); entrusting pastoral care to someone other than a priest (c517.2); and appointing a single priest to pastor more than one parish (c526.1). The effect of each of these models on the change in parish Sunday Mass attendance is empirically estimated. No significant difference in Mass attendance was found between those parishes that had experienced an organizational restructuring and those that had not. When comparing the three different models of parish restructuring, parishes that were led by a team of priests were found to outperform parishes that had experienced the other two restructuring options.},
