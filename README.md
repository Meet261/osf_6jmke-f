# Executable Environment for OSF Project [6jmke](https://osf.io/6jmke/)

This repository was automatically generated as part of a project to test the reproducibility of open science projects hosted on the Open Science Framework (OSF).

**Project Title:** Who cares? Pastoral care in Dutch Protestant Parishes

**Project Description:**
> Pastoral care in parishes is a rather “silent” religious practice. As a result, data regarding the quantity and quality of regular pastoral care in local churches is scarce. To address this deficiency, we added several questions about pastoral care and support to the Church Life Survey and then carried out the survey with church attenders (N = 2,854) from 30 Dutch Protestant parishes. [...] This study reveals a wide range of quantitative and qualitative insights into the frequency and quality of pastoral care as a religious practice, a practice that is not often discussed but which is of great importance to church attenders and is now a practice that is being given a voice through data.

**Important Note:** The contents of the `6jmke_src` folder were cloned from the OSF project on **12-03-2025**. Any changes made to the original OSF project after this date will not be reflected in this repository.

The `DESCRIPTION` file was automatically added to make this project Binder-ready. For more information on how R-based OSF projects are containerized, please refer to the `osf-to-binder` GitHub repository: [https://github.com/Code-Inspect/osf-to-binder](https://github.com/Code-Inspect/osf-to-binder)

## flowR Integration

This version of the repository has the **[flowR Addin](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/rstudio-addin-flowr)** preinstalled. flowR allows visual design and execution of data analysis workflows within RStudio, supporting better reproducibility and modular analysis pipelines.

To use flowR, open the project in RStudio and go to `Addins` > `flowR`.

## How to Launch:

**Launch in your Browser:**

🚀 **MyBinder:** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/code-inspect-binder/osf_6jmke-f/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)

   * This will launch the project in an interactive RStudio environment in your web browser.
   * Please note that Binder may take a few minutes to build the environment.

🚀 **NFDI JupyterHub:** [![NFDI](https://nfdi-jupyter.de/images/nfdi_badge.svg)](https://hub.nfdi-jupyter.de/r2d/gh/code-inspect-binder/osf_6jmke-f/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)

   * This will launch the project in an interactive RStudio environment on the NFDI JupyterHub platform.

**Access Downloaded Data:**
The downloaded data from the OSF project is located in the `6jmke_src` folder.

## Run via Docker for Long-Term Reproducibility

In addition to launching this project using Binder or NFDI JupyterHub, you can reproduce the environment locally using Docker. This is especially useful for long-term access, offline use, or high-performance computing environments.

### Pull the Docker Image

```bash
docker pull meet261/repo2docker-6jmke-f:latest
```

### Launch RStudio Server

Run the container (with a name, e.g. `rstudio-dev`):
```bash
docker run -it --name rstudio-dev --platform linux/amd64 -p 8888:8787 --user root meet261/repo2docker-6jmke-f bash
```

Inside the container, start RStudio Server with no authentication:
```bash
/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/rserver --www-port 8787 --auth-none=1
```

Then, open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)

> **Note:** If you're running the container on a remote server (e.g., via SSH), replace `localhost` with your server's IP address.
> For example: `http://<your-server-ip>:8888`
